Scripts to parse the raw text data into nice JSON files.

### Instructions: 

Run with node.js

Each script takes one command line arugment of the filename (without the extension) of the text file to convert.

Ex: To generate link and node data for a force-directed graph form the raw data text file 20061101.txt, use:

```
(path to folder with script and datafile) > node genGraphData.js 20061101
```
